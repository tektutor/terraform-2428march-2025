# Day 5

## Info - Terraform Provider Development best practices and recommended naming conventions
<pre>
- Provider name must be terraform-provider-nameoftheprovider, must be all lower case
- Resource names must start with nameoftheprovider-resource i.e docker_container, docker is the provider name while the resource managed is container
- resource and data source name must be all lowercase separated by underscore, and recommened to restrict to 2 or 3 words at the max
</pre>

## Info - Commons causes of Configuration Drift
<pre>
- manual changes
- inconsistent and manual deployments
- external dependencies
- difference in environments
- lack of version control
- poor or lack of documentation
</pre>

## Info - Risks associated with Configuration Drifts
<pre>
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Compliance issues
- Makes troubleshooting very difficult
- increased down-time
- decreased reliability
- poor user-experience
</pre>

## Info - Solution to Configuration Drifts
<pre>
- Using Version Control
- Continuous Integration
- Use Configuration Management Tools to override manual changes in continuous fashion
- Use Infrastructure as Code Tools to override manual changes
- Regularly monitor and audit infrastructure
</pre>

## Info - Monitoring
<pre>
- is the process of collecting and analyzing data from IT infrastructure, system and processes
- using the data to improve business outcomes and drive value to the organization
- collects data to help keep your infrastructure up and running without any downtime
- Tools to
  - Data Collection (Logs)
  - Alerting
  - Remediation
  - Agent based monitoring
  - Agentless monitoring
  - Collecting Metrics
- Examples
  - Dynatrace
  - DataDog
  - Splunk
  - Prometheus & Grafana
</pre>

## Continuous Integration (CI) Overview
<pre>
- it is a fail-fast engineering process to find issues early 
- when bugs are detected early during development phase, they are easy to fix
- cost of fixing the bugs is also relatively cheaper
- it is similar SCRUM daily stand-up meeting, which is an inspect and adapt meeting
- the team that follows CI/CD, the engineers would be pushing code to version control several times a day
- code would be integrated many times a day
- Jenkins or similar CI/CD server will grab the latest code, they trigger a build, as part of the build, automated test cases would be executed to verify if the new code is as expected, if the new code is breaking any existing functionality.
- the build that was triggered due to new code integration succeeds, it means no functionality is broken, everything works as expected
- continous frequent feedback is given by CI/CD builds, eventually improving the code quaility and functional quality
- CI helps confidently deliver releases in a short amount of time
- Unit and Integration is the scope of CI
</pre>

## Continuous Deployment (CD) Overview
<pre>
- Once the dev release suceeds all the automated test cases added by dev team, it is automatically promoted for QA testing
- the dev certified release binaries are deployed automatically to QA environment for further automated QA testing
- the QA would automate, end to end functionality test, regression test, smoke test, performance test, stress test, component/API test, etc
</pre>

## Continuous Delivery (CD) Overview
<pre>
- the QA certified build(release) is automatically deployed into production or pre-prod environment
- in the pre-prod environment the customer or the Operations team would verify if the new release is working as expected
- especially fintech companies, after manual approval the binaries could go live in production environment
</pre>

## What is Jenkins?
- is a build automation server
- used mainly for CI/CD Builds
- this was developed in Java by Kohsuke Kawaguchi, former employee of Sun Microsystems
- Initially it was developed as Hudson is an opensource project
- Then Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, then part of Hudson including Kohsuke Kawaguchi had quit Oracle
  created a new branch from Hudson called Jenkins
- The other part of the Hudson team they continue to develop the product as Hudson
- There is lot common code between Hudson and Jenkins
- More than 10000 active contributors are there for Jenkins
- Many other software vendors got inspired by Jenkins similar products came out in market like Bamboo, Team City, Microsoft TFS, etc.,
- Jenkins supports CI/CD build for products built in any software stack
  
## What is Cloudbees?
- Cloudbees is the enterprise paid variant of Jenkins
- Feature wise Jenkins and Cloudbees pretty much they are same
- We get support for Cloudbees while we only get community support for Jenkins
- Cloudbees is more stable as it is a paid version
  
## Jenkins Alternatives
- Bamboo
- Team City
- Cloudbees ( Enterprise Jenkins )
- Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)

## Lab - Download Jenkins war file
Download the Generic Java Package (war) file from the left side (LTS)
<pre>
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.492.1/jenkins.war
</pre>

Expected output

## Lab - Launching Jenkins from terminal
```
cd ~/Downloads
java -jar ./jenkins.war
```
