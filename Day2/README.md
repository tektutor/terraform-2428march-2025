## Info - SOLID Design Principles
<pre>
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)
    - a good design should be open for extension without modifying existing code
    - we can add new code in new files
L - Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP)
I - Interface Seggregation Principle 
D - Dependency Injection or Dependency Inversion or Inversion of Control(IOC)
</pre>

## Info - Ansible tools
<pre>
ansible - used to run ansible ad-hoc command ( invoking a single ansible module without writing an ansible playbook )
ansible-playbook - used to run ansible playbooks ( end to end automation that invokes multiple ansible modules )
ansible-doc - used to get help about any ansible module(s)
ansible-galaxy - used to download/install/develop custom ansible roles
ansible-vault - used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data like login credentials, certs, etc.,
</pre>

## Info - Ansible Role
<pre>
- ansible roles helps write reusable code
- ansible roles are like Dynamic Link Library with reusable functions
- just like we can't run the DLL directory, we can't run the ansible roles directly
- just like DLL are loaded in application, after dynamically loading & linking functions from DLL application is able to invoke the functions defined in the DLL, same way ansible playbooks can invoke the ansible roles
- For what all purpose we could develop Ansible Role
  - let's say you wish to install nginx in multiple Linux distributions, you could develop a custom nginx role
  - let's say you wish to install weblogic in multiple OS ( Linux, Windows & Mac ) you could develop a custom weblogic role
  - let's say you wish to install Kubernetes in multiple OS ( Many Linux Distributions ), this could developed as a kubernetes role
- Ansible roles would look like an Ansible Playbook, but it can't be run directly, can only be invoked from Ansible Playbooks
- it follows specific recommended folder structures and many Ansible best practices
</pre>

## Demo - Developing a custom ansible role to install nginx in Rocky and Ubuntu Linux Distributions
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/ansible-custom-role
ansible-galaxy init nginx
tree nginx
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c494c820-7931-4fa8-b7fb-5fd541524231)

Note
<pre>
defaults - has read-only(static - which is not going change while playbook runs) user-defined variables 
vars - has regular variables 
files - copy ansible modules picks the files we mention under src attribute from this folder
handlers 
- based on notification, certain tasks can be executed on demand at run time
- in case, you wish to restart a service once you made some config changes the config task can notify the restart handler
tasks - will contain all the tasks we normally write in an ansible playbook
templates - template module picks the files we mention under src attribute from this folder
tests - contains a test inventory and test playbook to demonstrate how one could invoke ansible role ( we are going to delete this)
</pre>

Running the ansible playbook that invokes our custom nginx ansible role
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025

## Lab - Securing sensitive data using ansible vault and using them in ansible playbook

When ansible-playbook prompts for password, type root as the password.

You need to create the ~/.my-vault-password as shown below
```
echo root > ~/.my-vault-password
```

Now you may proceed with the below commands
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/vault
ansible-vault create mysql-login-credentials.yml
cat mysql-login-credentials.yml

ansible-vault view mysql-login-credentials.yml
ansible-vault edit mysql-login-credentials.yml
ansible-vault decrypt mysql-login-credentials.yml
cat mysql-login-credentials.yml
ansible-vault encrypt mysql-login-credentials.yml
cat playbook.yml
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
cat ansible.cfg
cat ~/.my-vault-password
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

## Info - Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform ( a.k.a Ansible Tower in the past )
<pre>
- this is an enterprise product developed by Red Hat on top of opensource AWX
- AWX is an opensource product that is developed on top of opensource Ansible core
- as AWX supports webconsole, Red Hat Ansibe Automation Platform also supports webconsole
- can invoke existing ansible playbooks
- supports RBAC(Role Based Access Control - User Management)
- Ansible AWX or Ansible Automation Platform can be installed on any Linux Distribution or within Kubernetes/Openshift
</pre>

## Lab - Launching Ansible Tower
```
minikube status
minikube start
minikube status
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected output
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67770ac8-263b-4444-a9f3-3fef880f3efc)

Accessing Ansible Tower Dashboard from chrome web browser on the Ubuntu lab machine
```
minikube service awx-demo-service --url -n ansible-awx
```
You can launch the AWS webconsole using the url shown in the above command
```
http://192.168.49.2:31225
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca51256e-8f4d-449f-9d35-7929f5dd9e50)

Ansible Tower Login Credentials , save the login credentials in a text file to avoid typing the below command each time to get password
<pre>
username - admin   
password - 
</pre>

To get the password, you need to type the below command
```
kubectl get secret awx-demo-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" -n ansible-awx | base64 --decode; echo
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cfcf13a-f4d5-49d9-8a36-ff1f261e73c7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05362dfd-4f54-4651-bd27-53962ae3a3e6)

## Troubleshooting - In case your ansible tower is not working, you will have to reinstall AWX
```
minikube delete
minikube start
```

Check if minikube is installed properly
```
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected output

Let's install AWX operator in minikube
```
cd ~
cd awx-operator/
git checkout 2.19.0
export NAMESPACE=ansible-awx
make deploy

kubectl get pods -n ansible-awx
```

Expected output
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df848ac8-be68-4e5e-8f43-092fffcd5d4f)

Track the progress of awx installation
```
kubectl logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager -c awx-manager -n ansible-awx
```
Expected output


Access the AWX dashboard
```
kubectl create -f awx-ubuntu.yml -n ansible-awx
kubectl get pods -n ansible-awx
kubectl get svc -n ansible-awx
minikube service awx-demo-service --url -n ansible-awx
```
Expected output
AWX Login Credentials
```
username - admin
```

To retrieve password
```
kubectl get secret awx-demo-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" -n ansible-awx | base64 --decode; echo
```

If everything went smooth, you are expected to see similar page

To access the awx dashboard from other machines, you need to do port-forwarding
```
kubectl port-forward service/awx-ubuntu-service -n ansible-awx --address 0.0.0.0 10445:80 &> /dev/null &
```

You may now access the dashboard from other machines as
```
http://10.0.1.72:10445
```

## Lab - Installing SSH Server on our lab machine
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y net-tools openssh-server
```

## Info - Go Programming Language Overview
<pre>
- is a programming language developed in C by Google
- later the go lang is recompiled/redeveloped in Go lang
- syntax wise, it is more or less similar to C Programming language
- also called as Golang
- golang design philosophy is to
  - keep it simple, hence it supports a total of just 25 keywords
  - loops - only for loop is supported
  - there are no class, only struct is supported to define user-defined data-type
  - supports pointers but manages memory using garbage collector
- golang supports the below basic data-types
  - bool
  - string
  - int, int8, int16, int32 and int64
  - uint, unit8, uint16, uint32, uintptr
  - byte ( alias of uint8 )
  - float32, float64( equivalent to double in most programming languages )
  - complex64, complex128
- it is a statically typed programming language
  - meaning, every variable must be declared before using it
- strongly typed
  - once a variable is declared as int, it will remain as integer throught the life-time of the application
- golang supports garbage collection
- some of the tools developed in golang
  - can be used to develop normal desktop applications, system utilities, compilers, interpreters, web application, AI 
  - Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, DropBox, etc.,
- it is faster than most compiled languages
  - faster than .Net, Java, etc.,
  - equivalent to C/C++ in terms of performance
- Editor recommended to develop golang is Microsoft's Visual Studio code
- Vim editor also works fine if you are comfortable 
- The below tools are developed in Go language
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - Openshift
  - DropBox
  - Terraform
