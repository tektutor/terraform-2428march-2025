# Day 2

## Lab - Managing Ubuntu and Rocky ansible node containers with a single ansible playbook
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/nginx
ansible-playbook install-nginx-playbook.yml

curl http://localhost:8001
curl http://localhost:8002
curl http://localhost:8003
curl http://localhost:8004

## Info - SOLID Design Principles
<pre>
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)
    - a good design should be open for extension without modifying existing code
    - we can add new code in new files
L - Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP)
I - Interface Seggregation Principle 
D - Dependency Injection or Dependency Inversion or Inversion of Control(IOC)
</pre>

## Lab - Running the refactored install nginx playbook 
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/nginx/after-refactoring
ansible-playbook install-nginx-playbook.yml

curl http://localhost:8001
curl http://localhost:8002
curl http://localhost:8003
curl http://localhost:8004
```

## Info - Ansible tools
<pre>
ansible - used to run ansible ad-hoc command ( invoking a single ansible module without writing an ansible playbook )
ansible-playbook - used to run ansible playbooks ( end to end automation that invokes multiple ansible modules )
ansible-doc - used to get help about any ansible module(s)
ansible-galaxy - used to download/install/develop custom ansible roles
</pre>

## Info - Ansible Role
<pre>
- ansible roles helps write reusable code
- ansible roles are like Dynamic Link Library with reusable functions
- just like we can't run the DLL directory, we can't run the ansible roles directly
- just like DLL are loaded in application, after dynamically loading & linking functions from DLL application is able to invoke the functions defined in the DLL, same way ansible playbooks can invoke the ansible roles
- For what all purpose we could develop Ansible Role
  - let's say you wish to install nginx in multiple Linux distributions, you could develop a custom nginx role
  - let's say you wish to install weblogic in multiple OS ( Linux, Windows & Mac ) you could develop a custom weblogic role
  - let's say you wish to install Kubernetes in multiple OS ( Many Linux Distributions ), this could developed as a kubernetes role
- Ansible roles would look like an Ansible Playbook, but it can't be run directly, can only be invoked from Ansible Playbooks
- it follows specific recommended folder structures and many Ansible best practices
</pre>

## Demo - Developing a custom ansible role to install nginx in Rocky and Ubuntu Linux Distributions
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/ansible-custom-role
ansible-galaxy init nginx
tree nginx
```

Note
<pre>
defaults - has read-only(static - which is not going change while playbook runs) user-defined variables 
vars - has regular variables 
files - copy ansible modules picks the files we mention under src attribute from this folder
handlers 
- based on notification, certain tasks can be executed on demand at run time
- in case, you wish to restart a service once you made some config changes the config task can notify the restart handler
tasks - will contain all the tasks we normally write in an ansible playbook
templates - template module picks the files we mention under src attribute from this folder
tests - contains a test inventory and test playbook to demonstrate how one could invoke ansible role ( we are going to delete this)
</pre>

Running the ansible playbook that invokes our custom nginx ansible role
```
cd ~/terraform-2428march-2025
git pull
cd Day2/ansible/ansible-custom-role
cat install-nginx-playbook.yml
ansible-playbook install-nginx-playbook.yml
```

./inventory
ansible all -m ping
```
